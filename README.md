A fun guessing game

User Story 1: As a user I want to have a button to click on to start the game so that I can control when the game has started.
User story 2: As a user I want a picture grid of characters that I can toggle, so I can keep track of who I've eliminated.
User story 3: As a user, I would like the target character to be randomly selected each game, so I am playing a different game each time.
User story 4: As a user, I would like to see hints displayed one at a time so I can eliminate characters.
User story 5: As a user , I would like to click to show the next hint.
